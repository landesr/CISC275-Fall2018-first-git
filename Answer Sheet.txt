QUESTION 1: In this space, type the sequence of commands you used to achieve the final state of all four files:

(I first created all 4 files in windows explorer)
$git add inRepo.txt
$git commit -m inRepo
$git add modified.txt
$git commit -m modified
(I then edited modified.txt)
$git  -m modified2
$git add staged.txt
$git status
-------------------
Produced these results: 
\On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   staged.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   modified.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        untracked.txt
